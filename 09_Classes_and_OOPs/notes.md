# Classes And JavaScript
- Yes, javaScript has Classes and Objects.This Feature introduced in ES6.
However, it's important to note that javaScript primarly a prototype language and its classes are syntatic sugar existing prototyped-based inheritance machanisms.
In Other words,it provides a more familar syntax for developers comming from class-based  languages such as Java or C++ but under the hood, it works differently.

So, while JavaScript does have classes,remember that they worksome what differently  from classes in languages  with  class- based  inheritance, due to javaScrpits's prototyped based nature.
